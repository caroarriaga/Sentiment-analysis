Maybe five teams more time to use the software.

I think there's a lot of material that we did not covered, because of the limited period of time we had in our hands


.
It could be useful to begin the distribution of the times like 1 or 2 weeks before, not the last end of the week

It was hard job to do with a short ponderation and short time to do it
El software era complicado
I'm very thankful for this project, i loved it

I liked this project :)
I think we should have more time to work with DELFTship


It would be good to have more time to do the project
the project was ok
More time for doubts about the software, maybe an introduction class for Delfship
Make all the calculation handmade by aproximations
Reduce the extension. The important thing is to get useful solutions.

I think it's a very complicated project and it takes a lot of time for us to have a final exam afterwards.


Better instructions so they can be less problems to everyone
I think that a way to do this correctly (maybe I'm proyecting here a bit) would be to ask the students for their designs in NX or in Solidworks (your choice) while you do the analysis and send a google docs to the students, and again for the redesign
