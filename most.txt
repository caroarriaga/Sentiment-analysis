The use of a challenge in the city
It was interesting
I liked a lot the fact of having to design different types of boats.


Interesting concepts
The practice of actually developing a project
It taught us some basic methods for designing projects such as the use of a decision matrix.
What I liked the most was designing on Solidworks and doing the simulations at delship
Elaborar diferentes tipos de designs de barcos y ver si funcionarian o no.
Playing with different models
The designing of the boats, it is such a complex engeenering
The use of all the knowledge learned from the course could be applied to a real life scenario

to understand how to organize information and take a decision
The opportunity to learn about new software
the thinking outside the boxes so that we could come up with solutions
Crear redesign de un producto existente y la comprobacion final.
Playing with different models
the ship design on cad
The challenge of the problem, for the last question, i didn't like the software (Inventor & Delfship.
Designing all the boats
Using the project and having a real life approach
reforzar los conocimientos aprendidos en clase
The concepts we use
the topic
The use of a software to analyze the boats
The subject and the modeling of ships, just a short class to the software would be better
Designing boats using NX or Solidworks was a blast! having to modify them bit by bit so they could work as a normal boat was very fun, also having to do matrixes to put our designs to the test, that was the best part of the project for me.
