# Sentiment analysis
A sentiment analysis and word cloud was performed to analyse a student survey.
 
# Files attached:
- Raw data of survey from two different student groups
 - Pre-assesment
 - Post-assesment
-R files
 - Word cloud
 - Sentiment analysis
  
# Objective
Understand if students are learning and if the proposed project is interesting for the students.
In particular, the "Design thinking" process applied during the engineering design of a boat.

# Data collection

## Pre-project
A project based approach was used for two groups of engineering students. Before the project started, each student was asked to complete a "pre-assesment" test to understand how much they knew of the class content.

## Post-project
Students were asked to complete a "post-assesment" to evaluate how much they learned during the activity.

## Survey
Students were asked to complete a survey to understand how much they liked the learning experience based on:

- Theme
- Content
- Tools
- Satisfaction

They were asked open ended questions which were analyzed with a word clound and a sentiment analysis.

# Results
Results can be reviewed in the paper "Teaching decision making in engineering using a multi-attribute
approach and ship design" published in Feb 24th, 2020 by the IEEE.
