2019-05-10,1,1,8,10,9,Yes,Yes,Yes,The software,The use of a challenge in the city,Maybe five teams more time to use the software.
2019-05-10,1,2,1,7,8,Yes,Yes,No,That we needed to learn to use a software tool that is extremely likely that we don't ever use it again in our careers. Maybe a project involving CFD would've been more useful,It was interesting,No more comments
2019-05-10,1,3,7,1,6,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I didn´t like the fact that not everybody was able to use delftship, the software, I would´ve liked to have the chance to explore and use the software myself",I liked a lot the fact of having to design different types of boats.,"I think there´s a lot of material that we did not covered, because of the limited period of time we had in our hands"

2019-05-10,1,6,5,7,7,Yes,Yes,No,Not much guidance.  Hard to use the software.,Interesting concepts,.
2019-05-10,1,7,10,8,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,The software usage,The practice of actually developing a project,"It could be useful to begin the distribution of the times like 1 or 2 weeks before, not the last end of the week"
2019-05-10,1,8,7,5,9,Yes,Yes,Yes,We required a bit more knowledge with the Delfthsip program. It was hard to work with and importing a project made on SoldiWorks didn't throw out expected results,It taught us some basic methods for designing projects such as the use of a decision matrix.,
2019-05-10,1,9,1,8,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,"The least would have liked the least, is looking for the prices of each accesory or thing of the boat",What I liked the most was designing on Solidworks and doing the simulations at delship,It was hard job to do with a short ponderation and short time to do it
2019-05-11,1,10,10,10,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,Que el lugar era el rio Santa Lucia y no daba mucha profundidad para hacer mejores diseños,Elaborar diferentes tipos de diseños de barcos y ver si funcionarian o no.,El software era complicado
2019-05-11,1,11,10,9,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I found this project extremely satisfying because i applied a lot of concepts regarding Hydrostatics, figuring out many ways to obtain a perfect boat. I like a lot the software that we used and most likely i'm going to use it again.",Playing with different models,"I'm very thankful for this project, i loved it"
2019-05-11,1,12,8,9,7,Yes,Yes,Yes,I would like to know a little bit more about the software,"The designing of the boats, it is such a complex engeenering",.
2019-05-11,1,13,10,8,10,Yes,Yes,No,The use of software with no training,The use of all the knowledge learned from the course could be applied to a real life scenario,"Sebastian Ortiz Vera
A01730742"
2019-05-11,1,14,8,8,8,Yes,Yes,Yes,I liked that I needed to investigate abuot engineering applications. I like it because here is when you apply class concept to real life problems,,
2019-05-11,1,15,9,8,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,that the concepts were applied in real life,to understand how to organize information and take a decision,I liked this project :)
2019-05-15,1,16,1,10,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,The trouble to transfer solid works to DELFTship,The opportunity to learn about new software,I think we should have more time to work with DELFTship
2019-05-16,1,17,8,9,9,Yes,Yes,Yes,"That only one person should use the software, it would have been easier that more people could use it for time purposes",the thinking outside the boxes so that we could come up with solutions,
2019-05-17,1,18,8,4,7,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Me ha recordado un poco a un proyecto de diseño industrial, tanto en la generacion de ideas como en la comprovacion final del diseño. Interesante aplicacion para ingeniería mecánica.",Crear rediseños de un producto existente y la comprobación final.,
2019-05-17,1,19,9,9,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,See how the models was emulated to real life to see if they are working.,Playing with different models,It would be good to have more time to do the project
2019-05-10,2,1,5,8,6,Yes,Yes,Yes,the interaction with the software,the ship design on cad,the project was ok
2019-05-10,2,2,3,4,6,Yes,Yes,Yes,-,"The challenge of the problem, for the last question, i didn't like the software (Inventor & Delfship.","More time for doubts about the software, maybe an introduction class for Delfship"
2019-05-10,2,3,8,9,8,Yes,Yes,Yes,That we needed to use teamviewer to use the DELFT Ship,Designing all the boats,Make all the calculation handmade by aproximations
2019-05-10,2,4,6,5,6,Yes,Yes,No,"The extension, too many things to be done. The important things are few compared to all that is needed to be done",Using the project and having a real life approach,Reduce the extension. The important thing is to get useful solutions.
2019-05-10,2,5,8,8,9,Yes,Yes,Yes,delftship,reforzar los conocimientos aprendidos en clase,
2019-05-10,2,6,8,7,9,Yes,Yes,Yes,The program was very difficult to use or complicated to make the project,The concepts we use,I think it's a very complicated project and it takes a lot of time for us to have a final exam afterwards.
2019-05-10,2,7,8,10,10,Yes,Yes,Yes,The time was to short to make a excelent project,the topic,
2019-05-11,2,8,8,6,10,Yes,Yes,No,I liked how we use the topics of the class to do this project,The use of a software to analyze the boats,
2019-05-11,2,9,4,8,5,Yes,Yes,Yes,The time to do it,"The subject and the modeling of ships, just a short class to the software would be better",Better instructions so they can be less problems to everyone
2019-05-11,2,10,5,4,10,Yes,Yes,No,I think that the worst part was having to use propietary software? having to learn and start to use delftship (some of us without even having computers that supported it) really left a bad taste because we felt powerless during the project.,"Designing boats using NX or Solidworks was a blast! having to modify them bit by bit so they could work as a normal boat was very fun, also having to do matrixes to put our designs to the test, that was the best part of the project for me.","I think that a way to do this correctly (maybe I'm proyecting here a bit) would be to ask the students for their designs in NX or in Solidworks (your choice) while you do the analysis and send a google docs to the students, and again for the redesign"
